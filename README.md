# Consumerism the game

This game is intended to serve as a teaching tool for highschool or college level economics classes. The primary goal is to allow students to take part in and experience a free market system with all the complexities and pitfalls that are difficult to intuit, but integral to the understanding of the subject matter.

The web application will be built on .net core, with the frontend framework yet to be decided upon.
